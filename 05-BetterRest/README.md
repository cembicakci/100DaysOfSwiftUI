#  BetterRest

<p>It’s designed to help coffee drinkers get a good night’s sleep by asking them three questions.</p> 

<li>When do they want to wake up?</li>
<li>Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?</li>
<li>How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?</li>

<br />
<p>Once we have those three values, we’ll feed them into <b><i>Core ML</i></b> to get a result telling us when they ought to go to bed</p>
